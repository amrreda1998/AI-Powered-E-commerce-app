## üåü Current Features

### Frontend
- **Modern UI/UX**: Responsive, visually appealing design with gradients, glassmorphism, and smooth animations (TailwindCSS)
- **Authentication**: Mock Google OAuth login flow (real OAuth planned)
- **Products Page**: Grid layout, semantic search bar, product cards with images, price, category, and details
